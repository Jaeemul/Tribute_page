        <h2>Some Ninjutsus Naruto uses:</h2> 
        <div class="tribute-info"  id="tribute-info">
          <ul><li><b>Shadow Clone Jutsu (Kaage bunshin nu jutsu)</b> - Makes multiple clones of himself.</li></ul>
          <ul><li><b>Rasengan</b> - A high concentrated chakra or energy ball.</li></ul>
          <ul><li><b>RasenShuriken</b> - A mixture of his wind type chakra nature with the rasengan</li></ul>
          <ul><li><b>Sage mode</b> - A mode where he can use chakra from nature to gain inhuman strength.</li></ul>
          <ul><li><b>Frog Kata</b> - Frog Kata is a form of taijutsu that can only be utilized by those who have trained at Mount Myoboku in the ways of Sage Mode. This type of taijutsu is excellent for both offense and defense and grants a great boost in strength, speed, durability, as well as reflexes, when it comes to fighting.</li></ul>
          <ul><li><b>Super Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan</b> - The Super Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan is one of his strongest techniques. Naruto accessed this power by making use of the Six Paths Sage Mode and tapping into his limitless reserves of chakra.</li></ul>
          <ul><li><b>Baryon mode</b> - Baryon Mode is an extremely powerful jutsu that was available to Naruto Uzumaki and Kurama when they were together. This jutsu used their chakra as raw materials to give rise to incredibly potent energy, akin to nuclear fusion, that far exceeded anything seen in the anime.</li></ul>
          <ul><li><b>Sage Art: Super Big Ball Rasengan Barrage</b> - This jutsu was used by Naruto Uzumaki against Kurama when the two fought inside Naruto's body. To perform this jutsu, Naruto utilized Sage Mode, following which he created several shadow clones and equipped each of them with a Rasengan.</li></ul>
          <ul><li><b>Lava Release: Rasenshuriken</b> - By using the chakra of Son GokÅ«, Naruto Uzumaki was able to mix his Lava Release Kekkei Genkai with the Rasenshuriken to create an extremely powerful jutsu. To put it into perspective, Might Guy barely did any damage to the God Tree while this jutsu chopped it in half with ease.</li></ul>

            <p>" I'm Uzumaki Naruto. What I like is ramen, especially the kind at Ichiraku ramen shop. What I dislike is three minute wait after you pour in the boiling water. My hobbies are eating ramen. And my dream... is to be the next hokage.. Dattebayoo.. "</p>
